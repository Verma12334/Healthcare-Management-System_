# Healthcare Management System

### A healthcare website that provides a smooth and efficient platform for patients to register, book appointments with doctors, and access essential medical services.

The implementation of this Healthcare Management System (HMS) in our IITG Hospital will enhance decision-making regarding hospital operations and workflow. It will enable better patient treatment, provide real-time access to reports, and facilitate quick access to patients' past clinical data. All these features contribute to improved patient outcomes and more streamlined hospital management.
